// Question 1: Is intendedNode always assigned the coordinator in static preference list?
// If it can be assigned another coordinator, then how is this used?
// I think this question is relevant for handling network partition, and then node outages

// Otherise, if fixed from static pref list, then how to handle

// Question 2: Does the coordinator node collect responses from all replicas, and
// then reply to client? Yes it does. We do not have all nodes reply to client directly.

// Question 3: Since Dyanmo doesn't provide any isolation guarantee in ACID, nodes
// don't need any locks when reading or writing data, right?  Do muliple clients
// cause any issues in Dynamo?  How to test? Multiple clients are meaningless.

// Question 4: Are transactions to the same coordinator serializable?

// Question 5: Should we make a test case to reorder messages or does that not a concern?

// Note: coordinator does the reconciliation

// Note: concurrent client updates is a useless test case since the last writer will win
// due to having a descendent vector time stamp, which is valid to apply directly in an update.

// However, if dynamo has a node outage / network partition, then we can have "concurrent" updates
// and need to use the Figure 3 case in the paper.
